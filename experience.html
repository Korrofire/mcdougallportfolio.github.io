	<h1> Experiences That Defined Me</h1>
	<p>My journey towards UX and web design wasn't a straight line. Originally, I planned to get a Computer Science
		degree and become a game developer. My time within FIRST Robotics and Western Aerospace Scholars (WAS) helped me 
		experience various fields of STEM in high school before I figured out design was the way to go. Nowadays, I like to show 
		off my time in those programs as well as a personal project of mine - streaming! I stream on Twitch when I'm not working or 
		attending classes, showing people the games that continuously inspire me.
