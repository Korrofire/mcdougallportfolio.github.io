	<h1>Projects</h1>
	<p> I have complete two main projects so far, both towards making information
		more understandable for others. I have worked with the Washington State Department of Revenue to 
		create postcard designs towards the Working Families Tax Credit program. I have also developed the concept
		design for a mock web browser widget called Lingua, dedicated to making research easier and help stop the 
		spread of misinformation. Another project I completed was a simple website where you could find information
		about Pokemon types.
