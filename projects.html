		<p id="projectsIntro"> I have complete two main projects so far, both towards making information
			more understandable for others. I have worked with the Washington State Department of Revenue to 
			create postcard designs towards the Working Families Tax Credit program. I have also developed the concept
			design for a mock web browser widget called Lingua, dedicated to making research easier and help stop the 
			spread of misinformation. Another project I completed was a simple website where you could find information
			about Pokemon types.

	<h2>Working Families Tax Credit Postcards</h2>

	<p>The Working Families Tax Credit is a program through the Washington State Department of Revenue (DoR) that helps people in need get money. 
	This money can go towards a family trip or groceries - anything that a working family may need. I was put into a team and tasked to create a 
	design the DoR could use to help people understand what the program was so they could apply to it. After around three months, my team and I made 
	three designs in three different launguages - English, Spanish, and Russian. The English and Spanish designs can be seen above. Incorporating 
	language justice and accessible design into a postcard was tricky but the end result gave me new knowledge - how to work with a client and 
	representing various cultures and backgrounds in a design.</p>

	<h2>Lingua Web Browser Widget</h2>
	<img id="linguaPic" src="photos/lingua.png" alt="parts of the Lingua web browser" width="500" align="center">
	<p>Lingua is a concept web browser widget created to help people understand sciencific discoveries online. When installed into a browser, a person could use it
	to easily search up unknown terms, look up the used sources, and check to see if it was a real discovery or not. This was my first time using the user centered
	design process, so having a great team helped me learn how to get some collecting data to the actual design. Lingua was a great way to create my first design that was
	not solely focused on engineering and/or computer science. It also showed how powerful making things simplified can truly be in the long run.</p>

	<h2>Pokemon Website</h2>

	</div>
	<p>Pokemon Typings is a website created to put the Pokemon typing system into a more simple format. Each type in the game has a set of 
	strengths and weaknesses, so the website's whole goal was to have them in a better format than a complex chart most databases have. I did this website
	with a partner for a netoworking course and it taught me how to use the basics of HTML and CSS. I used to code in Java and get super confused, but HTML and 
	CSS are visual coding languages that make so much sense to a visual learner like me. Using a topic I love for a project was a great way to learn about website
	design conventions and a new way to code. You can visit the website <a href="http://cssgate.insttech.washington.edu/~_312tm9/index.html">here</a> if you are interested!</p>
