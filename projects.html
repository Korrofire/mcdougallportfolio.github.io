	<div class="topBox">
		<p> I have complete two main projects so far, both towards making information
			more understandable for others. I have worked with the Washington State Department of Revenue to 
			create postcard designs towards the Working Families Tax Credit program. I have also developed the concept
			design for a mock web browser widget called Lingua, dedicated to making research easier and help stop the 
			spread of misinformation. Another project I completed was a simple website where you could find information
			about Pokemon types.
